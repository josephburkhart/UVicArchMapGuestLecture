# UVic Archaeological Mapping Guest Lecture

This private repository contains essential files from the guest lecture I gave on archaeological mapping at the University of Victoria on March 25th, 2022.

## Usage

Anyone is free to use any of the files in this repository however they want.

## Contents

- `MockMap`: folder containing the files used to create maps of a fictional archaeological site on UVic campus.
- `DemoMap`: folder containing the files used during the live demonstration. These include `LargeMap.jpg` and `SmallMap.jpg`, which are the maps of the fictional archaeological site created from the files in `MockMap`
- `handout.pdf`: handout containg a summary of the lecture, including the live demonstration, and links to useful resources.
